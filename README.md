# Microservices Application for E-Commerce

## Overview
This repository contains the microservices architecture for a simulated e-commerce application. It's designed to demonstrate a cloud-native approach using Kubernetes and Dapr. The application is divided into four main components, each residing in its own directory:

1. **order-processing-app**: Manages the processing of orders.
2. **recommendation-app**: Handles product recommendations.
3. **stock-management-app**: Responsible for stock level management.
4. **storefront-app**: Represents the user-facing application for the storefront.

## Solution Architecture Diagram
Below is the solution architecture diagram for the e-commerce application:

## Pre-requisites
- A Kubernetes cluster.
- Dapr configured on the Kubernetes cluster.
- Redis installed on the Kubernetes cluster.
- Zipkin installed for tracing.
- Basic understanding of Kubernetes resource definitions.

### Installing Dapr using Helm
To install Dapr on your Kubernetes cluster using Helm, follow these steps:
```bash
helm repo add dapr https://dapr.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update
kubectl create namespace dapr-system
helm install dapr dapr/dapr --namespace dapr-system
```

### Installing Redis using Helm
Redis is used for state management and caching. To install Redis on your Kubernetes cluster, use the following Helm commands:
```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update
helm install redis bitnami/redis --namespace <your-namespace>
```
**Note**: Replace `<your-namespace>` with the namespace where you want to deploy Redis. This namespace should be the same as where your microservices will be deployed.

### Installing Zipkin for Tracing
Zipkin provides distributed tracing functionality. To install Zipkin, use the following Helm commands:
```bash
helm repo add openzipkin https://openzipkin.github.io/zipkin/
helm repo update
helm install zipkin openzipkin/zipkin
```
**Note**: To configure Dapr to send traces to Zipkin, update the Zipkin `endpointAddress` in `./order-processing-app/k8s/base/dapr-tracing-config.yaml` to include Zipkin as a tracing backend.

## Deployment Instructions

### Common Setup
Before deploying the services, complete the following setup:

1. Create the `e-commerce-app` namespace where all the microservices will be deployed:
   ```bash
   kubectl create namespace e-commerce-app
   ```
2. Update your Redis host and Redis password in `./order-processing-app/k8s/common/redis-secret.yaml`.
3. Apply the Redis secret:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f ./order-processing-app/k8s/common/redis-secret.yaml -n e-commerce-app
   ```
4. Build and push Docker images for each microservice. Ensure each folder has a Dockerfile. Run the following commands:

   First, log in to Docker Hub:
   ```bash
   docker login
   ```

   In the `order-processing-app` folder:
   ```bash
   docker build -t <your-docker-hub-username>/order-processing-app:latest .
   docker push <your-docker-hub-username>/order-processing-app:latest
   ```

   In the `stock-management-app` folder:
   ```bash
   docker build -t <your-docker-hub-username>/stock-management-app:latest .
   docker push <your-docker-hub-username>/stock-management-app:latest
   ```

   In the `recommendation-app` folder:
   ```bash
   docker build -t <your-docker-hub-username>/recommendation-app:latest .
   docker push <your-docker-hub-username>/recommendation-app:latest
   ```

   In the `storefront-app` folder:
   ```bash
   docker build -t <your-docker-hub-username>/storefront-app:latest .
   docker push <your-docker-hub-username>/storefront-app:latest
   ```

   **Note**: Replace `<your-docker-hub-username>` with your actual Docker Hub username. The `latest` tag indicates the most recent version, but consider using specific version tags for better version control.

5. Update the image names in the Kubernetes configuration in `./k8s/overlays/development/kustomization.yaml` for each service.

**Note on Building Docker Images in Kubernetes**:
There are various methods for building Docker images in Kubernetes environments, each suited to different requirements. You could choose the one that best suits your project:

- **Current Approach (Using Docker Hub)**: As shown earlier, build and push images to Docker Hub using the `docker build` and `docker push` commands.
- **Buildpacks**: Streamlines image creation from code. [Discover Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/).
- **Buildah**: A great choice for OCI images. [Learn more about Buildah](https://buildah.io/).
- **kaniko**: Builds images securely within Kubernetes clusters. [More on kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko).
- **Jib**: Optimized for Java applications, builds images without needing Dockerfiles. [Explore Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib).
- **KO**: Designed specifically for Go applications. [Read about KO](https://github.com/google/ko).

Each option provides distinct benefits, making them suitable for various scenarios and requirements.

### Deploying the Microservices
Deploy the microservices with the following commands:
```bash
kubectl apply -k ./order-processing-app/k8s/overlays/development/ -n e-commerce-app
kubectl apply -k ./recommendation-app/k8s/overlays/development/ -n e-commerce-app
kubectl apply -k ./stock-management-app/k8s/overlays/development/ -n e-commerce-app
kubectl apply -k ./storefront-app/k8s/overlays/development/ -n e-commerce-app
```

### Deleting the Microservices
To remove the services, use:
```bash
kubectl delete -k ./order-processing-app/k8s/overlays/development/ -n e-commerce-app
kubectl delete -k ./recommendation-app/k8s/overlays/development/ -n e-commerce-app
kubectl delete -k ./stock-management-app/k8s/overlays/development/ -n e-commerce-app
kubectl delete -k ./storefront-app/k8s/overlays/development/ -n e-commerce-app
```

## Validation Steps
After deployment, verify that the microservices are running correctly with:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n e-commerce-app
```

## Troubleshooting Tips
If you encounter issues during deployment or runtime, use these steps to identify and resolve common problems:

1. **Checking Pod Logs**:
   - For a specific microservice's pod:
     ```bash
     kubectl logs <pod-name> -n e-commerce-app
     ```
   - For the Dapr sidecar in a pod:
     ```bash
     kubectl logs <pod-name> -c daprd -n e-commerce-app
     ```

2. **Checking Dapr Sidecar Injector Logs and Restarting if Necessary**:
   - If experiencing certificate issues or problems with sidecar injection, first check the logs:
     ```bash
     kubectl logs -l app=dapr-sidecar-injector -n dapr-system
     ```
   - Restarting the `dapr-sidecar-injector` can sometimes resolve these issues:
     ```bash
     kubectl rollout restart deployment/dapr-sidecar-injector -n dapr-system
     ```

3. **Describing Pods**:
   - If a pod is failing to start, use `describe` to get more details:
     ```bash
     kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n e-commerce-app
     ```

4. **SSH into Pods**:
   - To access a shell within a pod:
     ```bash
     kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -n e-commerce-app -- /bin/bash
     ```
   - Specify the container name if the pod contains multiple containers:
     ```bash
     kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -c <container-name> -n e-commerce-app -- /bin/bash
     ```

5. **General Steps**:
   - Verify correct installation and configuration of all pre-requisites.
   - Inspect Kubernetes resources (namespaces, services, deployments, pods) using `kubectl get` commands.
